Function 1: Allows users an easy way to store and access files using advanced GUIs

Operating systems allow you a simple way to store and organize large amounts of information and access them via the GUI. 
With the advent of personal computers came advanced graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which significantly decreased the skill and knowledge needed to understand how to operate computers.
GUIs provide a simple visual means by which the user can understand how to store and organize files in whichever way they desire.
